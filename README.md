# FDA Drug Approval Trends (2010–2024)

This repository presents a data analysis project exploring **FDA new drug and biologic approvals (2010–2024)** using publicly available data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (CDER).  
The project applies **Python-based analytics and visualization** to uncover regulatory and innovation patterns in the biopharmaceutical industry.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze FDA approvals (NDA vs. BLA) from 2010–2024  
- Classify drugs by **therapeutic area**  
- Identify **top applicant companies**  
- Examine **accelerated approval** trends  
- Evaluate **Orphan / Breakthrough / Fast Track** designations  
- Explore **Priority Review Voucher (PRV)** programs

## Modules
| # | Title | Focus |
|:-:|--------|--------|
| **01** | FDA Drug Approvals (NDA vs. BLA) | Yearly trends of NME vs. biologic approvals |
| **02** | Approvals by Therapeutic Area | Keyword-based and manual classification |
| **03** | Approvals by Company | Top applicants and merger-adjusted groups |
| **04** | Accelerated Approvals | Annual proportion and growth patterns |
| **05** | Expedited Designations | Orphan / Breakthrough / Fast Track overlap |
| **06** | Priority Review Vouchers | Issuance and redemption (RPD, TD, MTMC) |

## Tools
- **Python 3.10**  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Key Findings
- Biologic drugs (BLA) have increased sharply since 2015  
- Oncology dominates accelerated and expedited approvals  
- Roche, BMS, Pfizer, and Novartis are consistent top innovators  
- PRV programs remain rare but strategically valuable
